Tutorial Part I (Linear Problems)
=================================

This tutorial should give you a good idea of how Hermes2D works. After reading it, you will
be able to create your own applications and/or adjust existing Hermes2D examples for your 
purposes. At the beginning of every section we give a reference to the corresponding example in the 
Hermes2D git repository -- there you will always find the corresponding main.cpp file, mesh file(s) etc.
The document is under continuous development - if you find bugs or would like us to 
improve something, let us know through the `mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/hermes2d/>`_.

Finite Element Mesh (01)
--------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `01-mesh <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/01-mesh>`_. 

Every finite element computation starts with partitioning the domain
into a finite element mesh. Hermes uses triangles and quadrilaterals, and 
can combine both element types in one mesh. While complicated meshes need 
to be constructed using specialized mesh generation software, in many cases 
we only need a simple initial mesh that can be created by hand. In Hermes, all you 
need to do is partition the domain very coarsely into several large elements,
and the adaptivity will take care of the rest. 

.. image:: img/simplemesh.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400
   :height: 400
   :alt: Sample finite element mesh.

The domain is defined via four macroelements -- two
quadrilaterals and two curvilinear triangles. The elements are enumerated from 0 to 3. 
One also needs to enumerate all mesh vertices and assign markers to all boundary edges. 
Boundary markers are used to link boundary conditions with the boundary edges. 

Mesh File Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hermes can read meshes in its own generic format as well as in the
`ExodusII <http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii/>`_ format
(this is, for example, the output of `Cubit <http://cubit.sandia.gov/>`_).
First let us discuss the generic Hermes mesh data format. Reading
of ExodusII mesh files is very simple as we will see in example "iron-water". 

Generic Hermes mesh file consists of variable assignments. Each variable can hold a real number, 
list of real numbers, or list of lists. The following are all valid definitions in 
the Hermes mesh file format::

    # comments start with a hash
    var = 5.0 + cos(pi)  # number
    list = { 1, 2, 3, 4, var }  # list
    pairs = { {1, 2}, {1, var}, {0, list} }  # list of lists

Every mesh file must contain at least the variables ``vertices``, ``elements``
and ``boundaries``. The variable ``vertices`` defines the coordinates
of all mesh vertices (in any order). In our case it looks like this::

    a = 1.0  # size of the mesh
    b = sqrt(2)/2

    vertices =
    {
      { 0, -a },    # vertex 0
      { a, -a },    # vertex 1
      { -a, 0 },    # vertex 2
      { 0, 0 },     # vertex 3
      { a, 0 },     # vertex 4
      { -a, a },    # vertex 5
      { 0, a },     # vertex 6
      { a*b, a*b }  # vertex 7
    }

The variable ``elements`` defines all elements in the mesh via zero-based indices of their vertices in counter-clockwise order, plus an extra number denoting the element (material) marker. Element markers allow you to use different material parameters in areas with different material parameters. Moreover, Hermes allows you to assign different weak formulations to those areas, which can be very useful for some types of multiphysics problems. If the domain is composed of only one material, as in our case, all elements may be assigned a zero marker:
::

    elements =
    {
      { 0, 1, 4, 3, 0 },  # quad 0
      { 3, 4, 7, 0 },     # tri 1
      { 3, 7, 6, 0 },     # tri 2
      { 2, 3, 6, 5, 0 }   # quad 3
    }

The last mandatory variable, ``boundaries``, defines boundary markers for all
boundary edges. By default, all edges have zero markers. Only those with
positive markers are considered to be part of the domain boundary and can be
assigned a boundary condition, as we will see later. An edge is identified by
two vertex indices. In our case, we have
::

    boundaries =
    {
      { 0, 1, 1 },
      { 1, 4, 2 },
      { 3, 0, 4 },
      { 4, 7, 2 },
      { 7, 6, 2 },
      { 2, 3, 4 },
      { 6, 5, 2 },
      { 5, 2, 3 }
    }

Finally, the file can also include the variable ``curves``, which lists all
curved edges.  Each curved edge is described by one NURBS curve, defined by its
degree, control points and knot vector. Simplified syntax is available for
circular arcs.

NURBS Curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every NURBS curve is defined by its degree, control points with weights and the
knot vector. The degree $d$ is a positive integer, usually 1, 2, 3 or 5. Lines
and polylines are of degree 1, circles have degree 2 and free-form curves are
of degree 3 or 5. The control points $p_i$, $i = 0 \ldots n$, are the main tool for changing the
shape of the curve. A curve of degree $d$ must have at least $d+1$ control
points. In Hermes, the endpoints of the edge are always assumed to be the
first and last control points and therefore only the inner control points are
listed in the mesh file. There is a weight $w_i \geq 0$ for every control point,
that influences the shape of the curve in its vicinity. If $w_i = 0$ then 
$p_i$ has no effect on the shape.  As $w_i$ increases, the curve is pulled 
towards $p_i$.

The knot vector is a sequence of $m+1$ values that determines how much and
where the control points influence the shape. The relation $m = n+d+1$ must
hold. The sequence is nondecreasing, $t_i \leq t_{i+1}$, and divides the whole
interval $[0,1]$ into smaller intervals which determine the area of influence
of the control points. Since the curve has to start and end at the edge
vertices, the knot vector in Hermes always starts with $d+1$ zeros and ends
with $d+1$ ones. Only the inner knots are listed in the above definition of the
variable ``curves``, where $knots$ is a simple list of real values. For the 
above example, we have
::

    curves =
    {
      { 4, 7, 45 },  # +45 degree circular arcs
      { 7, 6, 45 }
    }
    # EOF


Loading Mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a ''Hello world'' example, let us load the mesh we have just created, and display it in a window. 
Every main.cpp file in the git repository contains lots of comments and instructions. Skipping those, 
the `main.cpp <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/tutorial/01-mesh/main.cpp>`_ 
file begins with creating an instance of the class Mesh. In order to load
the mesh file, you have to create a mesh loader class (in our case that is ``H2DReader``) and
call the method ``load()``:
::

    #include "hermes2d.h"

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      // load the mesh file
      Mesh mesh;
      H2DReader mloader;
      mloader.load("domain.mesh", &mesh);

Note: To load the exodus-II mesh file, one has to use ``ExodusIIReader`` class instead.

The following portion of code illustrates various types of initial mesh refinements.
It does not matter if the mesh becomes irregular, in fact, arbitrarily irregular
meshes are at the heart of Hermes: 
::

      // perform some sample initial refinements
      mesh.refine_all_elements();          // refines all elements
      mesh.refine_towards_vertex(3, 4);    // refines mesh towards
                                           // vertex #3 (4x)
      mesh.refine_towards_boundary(2, 4);  // refines all elements
                                           // along boundary 2 (4x)
      mesh.refine_element(86, 0);          // refines element #86
                                           // isotropically
      mesh.refine_element(112, 0);         // refines element #112
                                           // isotropically
      mesh.refine_element(84, 2);          // refines element #84
                                           // anisotropically
      mesh.refine_element(114, 1);         // refines element #114
                                           // anisotropically

Other ways of modifying meshes on the fly include
::

    Mesh::refine_element(int id, int refinement = 0);
    Mesh::convert_quads_to_triangles();
    Mesh::convert_triangles_to_quads();
    Mesh::refine_by_criterion(int (*criterion)(Element* e), int depth);
    Mesh::refine_towards_vertex(int vertex_id, int depth);
    Mesh::regularize(int n);
    Mesh::unrefine_element(int id);
    Mesh::unrefine_all_elements();

See the file `src/mesh.cpp <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/mesh.cpp>`_ for more details. 
The following code illustrates how to visualize the mesh using the class MeshView:
::

    // display the mesh
    // (100, 100) is the upper left corner position
    // 500 x 500 is the window size
    MeshView mview("Hello world!", 100, 100, 500, 500);
    mview.show(&mesh);

You can initialize it by supplying the title of the window and its initial position and size (all of these
parameters are optional). The class MeshView provides the method show() that displays a window showing the mesh:

.. image:: img/meshview2.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400
   :height: 400
   :alt: Image of the mesh created via the MeshView class.

Every main.cpp file is finished with 
::

    // wait for keyboard or mouse input
    View::wait();
    return 0;
  }

so that you have a chance to see the graphical output.



Setting Up Finite Element Space (02)
------------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `02-space <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/02-space>`_. 

Hermes follows the mathematical concept of FEM closely -- after creating a mesh,
in the next step one needs to construct a finite element space on it.
The following predefined spaces are currently available:

* H1Space - the most common space of continuous, piecewise-polynomial functions belonging to $H^1(\Omega) = \{ v \in L^2(\Omega); \nabla u \in [L^2(\Omega)]^2 \}$,
* HcurlSpace - the space of vector-valued functions discontinuous along mesh edges, with continuous tangential component on the edges $H(\mbox{curl},\Omega) = \{ E \in [L^2(\Omega)]^2; \nabla \times E \in L^2(\Omega)\}$,
* HdivSpace - the space of vector-valued functions discontinuous along mesh edges, with continuous normal component on the edges $H(\mbox{div},\Omega) = \{ v \in [L^2(\Omega)^2; \nabla \cdot v \in L^2(\Omega)\}$,
* L2Space -  the space of functions discontinuous along mesh edges, belonging to the space $L^2(\Omega)$.

All these spaces allow for higher-order elements and meshes with arbitrary-level hanging nodes.
If you are not familiar with higher-order FEM, let us just say that the spaces can contain
quadratic, cubic, etc., *edge functions* that generate higher-degree
polynomials along mesh edges, and *bubble functions* that complete the higher-order
approximation in element interiors. Edge functions are associated with mesh edges,
and bubble functions with element interiors. The next figure shows a patch consisting of two triangular elements. An edge function is shown on the left, and a bubble function on one of the triangles on the right:

.. image:: img/basisfn.jpg
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :height: 200
   :alt: Fourth-order edge function  (left) and one of the fifth-order bubble functions (right).

There are many possible ways of defining the
higher-order basis functions. A particular set of polynomials is called
*shapeset*. Using good shapeset is crucial for the
performance of the *hp*-FEM. No shapeset can be optimal for all possible operators.
Therefore, Hermes offers several shapesets from which
you need to choose one when creating a FE space. The ones which perform best
in most computations (according to our experience) are simply called
H1Shapeset, HcurlShapeset, HdivShapeset and L2Shapeset.
Others can be found in the files `src/shapeset* <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/src>`_ in the git repo.
Any shapeset can be used for more than one space.

We are now ready for an example. The following code snippets come from
the `main.cpp <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/tutorial/02-space/main.cpp>`_ file. 
We assume that a mesh has already been loaded. First we create an instance of H1Shapeset and then an
instance of H1Space, supplying the mesh and shapeset pointers:
::

    // create a shapeset and an H1 space
    H1Shapeset shapeset;
    H1Space space(&mesh, &shapeset);

When the space is created, we need to initialize the polynomial
degrees of all elements. (The words *degree* and *order* have the same meaning for us.)
This can be done for individual elements by calling the method
Space::set_element_order(), or for all elements at once using
Space::set_uniform_order(). It is important to note that element degrees
are stored in Space, not in Mesh. The reason is that you can
have multiple different spaces with different element degrees and even types 
over the same mesh. In Hermes, Mesh only stores geometrical information.
::

    // assign element orders and initialize the space
    space.set_uniform_order(P_INIT);
    // enumerate degrees of freedom
    assign_dofs(&space);

A space created in this way is ready for use. By default, it is equipped with
zero Neumann boundary conditions on the entire domain boundary. Later we will see
how to change that.

As a debugging/learning feature, Hermes enables visualization of all basis functions 
in a Space. Similarly to MeshView, you can create a BaseView object and use it 
to display the entire basis (VectorBaseView has to be used for vector-valued 
approximations in spaces Hcurl and Hdiv - this will be discussed later). 
You can cycle through all basis functions in the window using the arrow keys. 
If you press the left mouse button at the beginning, you will see the Dirichlet 
lift (a function that represents Dirichlet boundary conditions).
::

    // view the basis functions
    BaseView bview;
    bview.show(&space);

This is how the last figure above was obtained (press the '3' key for 3D mode).
We suggest that you spend some time experimenting with element refinements and 
hanging nodes to see how basis functions on irregular meshes look like.

Solving Poisson Equation (03)
-----------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `03-poisson <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/03-poisson>`_. 

Let us solve the Poisson equation

.. math::
    :label: poisson1

       -\Delta u = CONST_F

on the L-shaped domain $\Omega$ from the previous example,
equipped with a homogeneous (zero) Dirichlet boundary condition

.. math::
    :label: poisson2

       u = 0\ \ \  \mbox{on}\  \partial \Omega,

where $CONST_F$ is a real number. The weak formulation 
is derived in the standard way, first by multiplying equation :eq:`poisson1` with a test
function $v$, then integrating over the domain $\Omega$, and then applying the Green's
theorem (integration by parts) to the second derivatives.
Because of the homogeneous Dirichlet condition :eq:`poisson2`,
the proper space for the solution is $V = H^1_0(\Omega)$. The weak formulation reads:
Find $u \in V$ such that

.. math::
    :label: poissonweak

         \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \;\mbox{d\bfx} = CONST_F \int_\Omega v \;\mbox{d\bfx} \ \ \ \mbox{for all}\ v \in V.

Equation :eq:`poissonweak` has the standard form $a(u,v) = l(v)$ and thus in Hermes
we need a way to specify the bilinear form $a(u,v)$ and the linear form $l(v)$.
In the code this is done by implementing the following two functions:
::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext);

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext);

These functions will be called for each element during the stiffness matrix
assembly and must return the values of the bilinear and linear forms for the given arguments.
RealFunction represents one of the basis functions restricted to the
current element and RefMap represents the reference mapping of the current element.
There are methods for extracting the values of the basis functions at integration points,
which allows you to evaluate the integrals by yourself, but this is normally not needed,
since many common weak forms have already been implemented.
In this case, we can simply use the predefined functions
int_grad_u_grad_v and int_v:
::

    // return the value \int \nabla u . \nabla v dx
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_grad_u_grad_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }
   
    // return the value \int v dx
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return CONST_F * int_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, v);
    }

We can now state our problem in the following way:

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form));
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(linear_form));

The class WeakForm represents the weak formulation of the PDE and must be
initialized with the number of equations in the system, in our case one. We then
supply the class pointers to our bilinear and linear form functions. If the PDE
was more complicated, we could add multiple bilinear and/or linear forms.

Given the weak formulation and the discretization determined by the space and its mesh,
we can proceed to the approximate solution of the problem by the Galerkin method.
This method is the core of Hermes and provides a way to obtain a sparse linear
system of equations, represented by the class LinSystem in the code. The solution
of the linear system then yields an approximate solution of the original problem.

The class LinSystem needs three things: your weak formulation, your spaces and
finally an external sparse matrix solver, for example CG or UMFPACK. The following lines
create the linear solver, initialize the LinSystem class and pass a pointer to
the H1Space we have created in the previous section.
::

    // initialize the linear system and solver
    UmfpackSolver umfpack;
    LinSystem sys(&wf, &umfpack);
    sys.set_spaces(1, &space);
    sys.set_pss(1, &pss);

The last line must be included for historical reasons. During matrix assembly,
Hermes caches the values of all shape function polynomials for better performance.
The cache is represented by the class PrecalcShapeset and you have to
include the following line at the beginning of your program:
::

    PrecalcShapeset pss(&shapeset);

Finally, we tell LinSystem to assemble the stiffness matrix and the right-hand
side and solve the resulting linear system: 
::

    // assemble the stiffness matrix and solve the system
    Solution sln;
    sys.assemble();
    sys.solve(1, &sln);

For the Poisson problem, we are finished. The last two lines can be repeated many 
times in time-dependent problems. The instance of the class Solution, upon the
completion of LinSystem::solve(), contains the approximate solution of
the PDE. You can ask for its values or you can visualize the solution immediately 
using the ScalarView class:
::

    // visualize the solution
    ScalarView view("Solution");
    view.show(&sln);

The following figure shows the output.

.. image:: img/poisson.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400
   :height: 350
   :alt: Solution of the Poisson equation.

Boundary Conditions (04, 05, 06)
--------------------------------

Hermes recognizes two basic types of boundary conditions: *essential* and *natural*.
Essential boundary conditions influence the finite element space while natural
conditions do not (they are incorporated into boundary integrals in the weak formulation).
In the context of elliptic problems, Dirichlet conditions are essential and Neumann/Newton
conditions are natural.

Dirichlet BC
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `04-bc-dirichlet <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/04-bc-dirichlet>`_. 

Since essential boundary conditions eliminate degrees of freedom (DOF) from the FE space, 
they need to be incorporated while the space is set up.
The user has to provide the following two callback functions:
::

    BCType bc_types(int marker);
    scalar essential_bc_values(int ess_bdy_marker, double x, double y);

The first one, given the boundary marker number, determines the type of BC which the associated
portion of the domain boundary belongs to, by returning one of the predefined constants 
BC_ESSENTIAL, BC_NATURAL, BC_NONE. The second callback needs to return the boundary value for a given marker
and position on the boundary (only needed for essential boundary condition markers - for natural
boundary conditions this value is ignored).
The space initialization can then look as follows:
::

    H1Space space(&mesh, &shapeset);
    space.set_bc_types(bc_types);
    space.set_essential_bc_values(essential_bc_values);

Suppose we would like to modify the previous Poisson model problem in the following way:

.. math::
         -\Delta u = CONST_F,\ u(x,y) = -\frac{CONST_F}{4}(x^2 + y^2)\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \partial \Omega.


Besides changing the linear form, we need to specify that all the boundary markers 1, 2, 3, 4
denote the essential boundary condition:
::

    BCType bc_types(int marker)
    {
      return BC_ESSENTIAL;
    }

Further, the value callback must return the value of the Dirichlet BC:
::

    scalar essential_bc_values(int ess_bdy_marker, double x, double y)
    {
      return (-CONST_F/4)*(x*x + y*y);
    }

It is easy to see that the solution to this problem is the function

.. math::
         u(x,y) = -\frac{CONST_F}{4}(x^2 + y^2). 

For the value $CONST_F = -4$, the output is shown below:

.. image:: img/dirichlet.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400
   :height: 350
   :alt: Solution of the Dirichlet problem.

Neumann BC
~~~~~~~~~~

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `05-bc-neumann <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/05-bc-neumann>`_. 

Next, let us consider Neumann boundary conditions. The new model problem
will have the form

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}   -\Delta u = CONST_F,\ \ \ \ \ &&u = 0\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \Gamma_4,\\                            &&\dd{u}{n} = C_1\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \Gamma_1,\\                            &&\dd{u}{n} = C_2\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \Gamma_2,\\                            &&\dd{u}{n} = C_3\,\ \mbox{on}\,\ \Gamma_3. \end{eqnarray*}

where $\Gamma_1 \dots \Gamma_4$ correspond to the edges marked $1 \dots 4$. Now, the weak formulation contains some surface integrals:

.. math::

    \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v \;\mbox{d\bfx} =   CONST_F\int_\Omega v \;\mbox{d\bfx}   + C_1\int_{\Gamma_1} \!v \;\mbox{d}l   + C_2\int_{\Gamma_2} \!v \;\mbox{d}l   + C_3\int_{\Gamma_3} \!v \;\mbox{d}l


In Hermes, all forms in the standard weak formulation $a(u,v) = l(v)$
are in fact defined as a sum of contributions from volume integrals and from
surface integrals. In the case of the linear form $l(v)$, this means

.. math::

    l(v) = \sum_m l_m^{\,\rm vol}(v) + \sum_n l_n^{\,\rm surf}(v).

We have already seen volumetric linear forms in example 03-poisson. 
Surface linear forms are implemented similarly. Our new right-hand side will
be represented by two functions with the following prototypes:

::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext);

and will be added to the WeakForm by the following code:

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form));
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(linear_form));
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, callback(linear_form_surf));

The surface linear form is defined as follows:

::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return CONST_GAMMA[e->marker - 1] * int_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, v);
    }

Here, we have used the predefined surface integral int_v (see the
file `src/integrals_h1.h <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/integrals_h1.h>`_). 
If the boundary conditions were more complicated, we could also
have used int_F_v, where F stands for an arbitrary user-supplied
function returning the value $\partial u/\partial n$.

Note that the mesh is refined towards the re-entrant corner in order to 
capture the singular gradient.
::

    // load the mesh file
    Mesh mesh;
    H2DReader mloader;
    mloader.load("domain.mesh", &mesh);
    mesh.refine_towards_vertex(3, CORNER_REF_LEVEL);

The gradient magnitude can be visualized via a MagFilter:

Newton BC
~~~~~~~~~

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `06-bc-newton <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/06-bc-newton>`_. 

Another common natural boundary condition is the Newton (sometimes called Robin) condition
of the form

.. math::

    \dd{u}{n} + c_1 u = c_2, \ \ \ \ c_1 \ne 0.

Analogously to Neumann conditions, also Newton conditions yield surface integrals. However,
this time they are both in the bilinear form and in the linear form,
The bilinear form is
a sum of volume and surface forms that can be added to the weak formulation using the methods
add_biform() and add_biform_surf(). 
The surface bilinear form must have the following prototype:
::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext);

Inside this function you can use predefined
forms such as int_u_v, int_F_u_v (see the
file `src/integrals_h1.h <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/integrals_h1.h>`_) or your custom forms.

The following code snippet contains the linear and bilinear forms:
::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_grad_u_grad_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return H * int_u_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return T0 * H * int_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, v);
    }

  

Here, $T_0$ is the exterior temperature, and $H$ is the heat flux.
The above forms are registered using
::

    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form));
    wf.add_biform_surf(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form_surf), 1);
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, callback(linear_form_surf), 1);

The last parameter in add_biform_surf() and add_liform_surf() is the boundary marker of the 
Newton boundary. The following figures show the solution and singularity of gradient 
at the re-entrant corner:

Determination of Quadrature Orders in Weak Forms
------------------------------------------------

You may wonder why templates are used in the definition of weak forms. As a matter of fact, 
they do not have to be, as we will see in a moment. However, if the weak form only contains 
algebraic operations (without if-then statements and such), templates help to determine
numerical integration orders automatically. In higher-order FEM, basis and test functions may 
have very different polynomial degrees, ranging from one and some maximum polynomial 
degree (currently 10 in Hermes). The basis and test functions can be combined inside the 
weak forms in many different ways. As a result, the minimum quadrature order which is needed 
to evaluate a weak form accurately may vary between zero (product of gradients of 
two linear functions) to infinity (whenever a nonpolynomial expression is present). 
Numerical quadrature is one of the trickiest issues in higher-order FEM.

A brute-force solution to this problem would be to integrate everything using 
a maximum order, but this would lead to tremendous computing times. Therefore Hermes offers 
two options: the polynomial degree of the integrated expressions can be detected 
automatically (via templates), or the user can define for each weak form the 
quadrature order explicitly. If the weak form only contains polynomial expressions, 
the former approach works very well. If the form is more complicated, it is recommended 
to handle the integration orders explicitly. 

Automatic order determination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In example 03-poisson, the bilinear and linear forms were defined using templates,

::

    // return the value \int \nabla u . \nabla v dx
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_grad_u_grad_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }

    // return the value \int v dx
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return CONST_F * int_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, v);
    }

and registered using the callback() macro,

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form));
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(linear_form));
   
The callback() macro, defined in `src/forms.h 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/forms.h>`_ by

::

    #define callback(a)     a<double, scalar>, a<Ord, Ord>

expands the above add_biform() and add_liform() functions into

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, bilinear_form<double, scalar>, bilinear_form<Ord, Ord>);
    wf.add_liform(0, linear_form<double, scalar>, linear_form<Ord, Ord>);

For those who are not familiar with templates, they make it possible to 
call the same function with different parameter types. In particular, 
using bilinear_form<double, scalar> and bilinear_form<Ord, Ord> for
the bilinear form defined above gives 

::

    scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<double> *u, Func<double> *v, Geom<double> *e, ExtData<scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_grad_u_grad_v<double, scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }

    Ord bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *u, Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      return int_grad_u_grad_v<Ord, Ord>(n, wt, u, v);
    }

The <double, scalar> copy is used to obtain the result of the numerical integration,
the <Ord, Ord> copy for automatic evaluation of the quadrature order. 
The parser (see `src/forms.h 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/forms.h>`_) 
works well for algebraic expressions. If the weak form bilinear_form() is complicated, 
one can create and register a simpler weak form bilinear_form_order() for the parser,
that provides an arbitrary expression with the same polynomial degree as 
the integrand in bilinear_form(). Then the two functions would be registered as 

::

    wf.add_biform(0, 0, bilinear_form, bilinear_form_order);

Of course the same holds for linear forms.
If the bilinear form contains things like the if-then statement, it cannot 
be parsed. Whenever the weak form contains non-polynomial expressions or
is otherwise very complicated, it is recommended to handle the quadrature 
orders manually.

Manual order determination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The polynomial degree of basis and test functions inside a bilinear or linear form 
can be handled manually as follows

::

    Ord bilinear_form_order(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *u, 
                          Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      int uo = u->val[0].get_order();
      int vo = v->val[0].get_order();
      return Ord(uo + vo);            // this would correspond to integral of u times v
    }

It is also possible to return a constant order (for example 5) by using 

::

    Ord bilinear_form_ord(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *u, 
                      Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      return Ord(5);
    }

Currently, one cannot make the integration order dependent on spatial coordinates and such. However,
one can assign different weak forms to elements with different material markers. This is
described in examples `iron-water <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/examples/iron-water>`_,
`saphir <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/examples/saphir/main.cpp>`_ and others.

The following example handles quadrature orders manually. 

General 2nd-Order Linear Equation (07)
--------------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `07-general <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/07-general>`_. 


This example deals with a linear second-order equation of the form 

.. math::

         -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(a_{11}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(a_{12}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(a_{21}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(a_{22}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) + a_1(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + a_{21}(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + a_0(x,y)u = rhs(x,y),

equipped with Dirichlet and/or Neumann boundary conditions. Its goal is to show how to 
use space-dependent coefficients and how to define quadrature orders explicitly. 

First we define the (generally) non-constant equation coefficients:
::

    double a_11(double x, double y) {
      if (y > 0) return 1 + x*x + y*y;
      else return 1;
    }

and so on. Then we define boundary conditions as usual. The weak formulation contains
both volumetric and surface integrals. 

The Ord class in Hermes (see the file `src/forms.h 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/forms.h>`_) provides
an automatic parser of weak forms that is able to determine the integration orders for 
algebraic expressions. So, in order to define an integration order explicitly, one can 
provide on top the weak form another function that defines a simple algebraic expression 
that leads the parser to the desired polynomial degree. The values defined in this  
additional function are not used for computation. 

::

    // (Volumetric) bilinear form
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      for (int i=0; i < n; i++) {
        double x = e->x[i];
        double y = e->y[i];
        result += (a_11(x, y)*u->dx[i]*v->dx[i] + 
                   a_12(x, y)*u->dy[i]*v->dx[i] +
                   a_21(x, y)*u->dx[i]*v->dy[i] +
                   a_22(x, y)*u->dy[i]*v->dy[i] +
                   a_1(x, y)*u->dx[i]*v->val[i] +
                   a_2(x, y)*u->dy[i]*v->val[i] +
                   a_0(x, y)*u->val[i]*v->val[i]) * wt[i];
      }
      return result;
    }

    // Integration order for the bilinear form
    Ord bilinear_form_ord(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *u, 
                      Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      return u->val[0] * v->val[0] * e->x[0] * e->x[0]; // returning the sum of the degrees of the basis 
                                                        // and test function plus two
    }

    // Surface linear form (natural boundary conditions)
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_F_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, g_N, v, e);
    }
  
    // Integration order for surface linear form
    Ord linear_form_surf_ord(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      return v->val[0] * e->x[0] * e->x[0];  // returning the polynomial degree of the test function plus two
    }
  
    // Volumetric linear form (right-hand side)
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return int_F_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, rhs, v, e);
    }
  
    // Integration order for the volumetric linear form
    Ord linear_form_ord(int n, double *wt, Func<Ord> *v, Geom<Ord> *e, ExtData<Ord> *ext)
    {
      return v->val[0] * e->x[0] * e->x[0];  // returning the polynomial degree of the test function plus two
    }

Note the sign of the surface linear form - all linear forms have to be on the right-hand side,
all bilinear forms on the left. 

The output of this example is shown below:

Systems of Equations (08)
-------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `08-system <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/08-system>`_. 

So far we always have solved a single linear PDE with the weak formulation
of the form $a(u,v) = l(v)$, where $u, v$ were continuous approximations in the
$H^1$ space. Analogously one can handle single equations whose solutions lie in the spaces
$Hcurl$, $Hdiv$ or $L^2$.

However, Hermes also can handle a system of $n$ linear PDEs, provided that the weak formulation 
can be written as

.. math::
    :label: weaksystem

      a_{11}(u_1,v_1)\,+ a_{12}(u_2,v_1)\,+ \cdots\,+ a_{1n}(u_n,v_1) = l_1(v_1),

      a_{21}(u_1,v_2)\,+ a_{22}(u_2,v_2)\,+ \cdots\,+ a_{2n}(u_n,v_2) = l_2(v_2),

                                                          \vdots

      a_{n1}(u_1,v_n) + a_{n2}(u_2,v_n) + \cdots + a_{nn}(u_n,v_n) = l_n(v_n).

The solution $u = (u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n)$ and test functions $v =
(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)$ belong to the space $W = V_1 \times V_2 \times \dots
\times V_n$, where each $V_i$ is one of the available function spaces.

Let us illustrate this by solving a simple problem of linear elasticity. Consider a
two-dimensional elastic body shown in the following figure (the bottom edge is
axis of planar symmetry):

.. image:: img/elastsample.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500
   :height: 300
   :alt: Geometry and boundary conditions.

In the plane-strain model of linear elasticity the goal is to determine the
deformation of the body subject to the forces $f$. The deformation is sought
as a vector function $u(x) = (u_1, u_2)^T$, describing the displacement of each point
$x \in \Omega$ after the load $f = (f_1, f_2)^T$ is applied.


The boundary conditions are

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}
    \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial n} &=& f_1 \ \text{on $\Gamma_3$,} \\
    \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial n} &=& 0 \ \text{on $\Gamma_2$, $\Gamma_4$, $\Gamma_5$,} \\
    \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial n} &=& f_2 \ \text{on $\Gamma_3$,} \\
    \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial n} &=& 0 \ \text{on $\Gamma_2$, $\Gamma_4$, $\Gamma_5$,} \\
    u_1 &=& u_2 = 0 \ \mbox{on} \ \Gamma_1. 
    \end{eqnarray*}

Applying the standard procedure to the elastostatic equilibrium equations, we arrive at the following weak formulation:

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}   \int_\Omega     (2\mu\!+\!\lambda)\dd{u_1}{x_1}\dd{v_1}{x_1} + \mu\dd{u_1}{x_2}\dd{v_1}{x_2} +     \mu\dd{u_2}{x_1}\dd{v_1}{x_2} + \lambda\dd{u_2}{x_2}\dd{v_1}{x_1}     \,\mbox{d}\bfx \!\!&=&\!\!\!     \int_{\Gamma_3} \!\!f_1 v_1 \,\mbox{d}S, \\ \smallskip   \int_\Omega     \mu\dd{u_1}{x_2}\dd{v_2}{x_1} + \lambda\dd{u_1}{x_1}\dd{v_2}{x_2} +     (2\mu\!+\!\lambda)\dd{u_2}{x_2}\dd{v_2}{x_2} + \mu\dd{u_2}{x_1}\dd{v_2}{x_1}     \,\mbox{d}\bfx \!\!&=&\!\!\!     \int_{\Gamma_3} \!\!f_2 v_2 \,\mbox{d}S. \end{eqnarray*}


We see that the weak formulation can indeed be written in the form :eq:`weaksystem`:

.. math::
    :nowrap:

    \begin{eqnarray*}
      a_{11}(u_1, v_1) \!&=&\! \int_\Omega (2\mu+\lambda)\dd{u_1}{x_1}\dd{v_1}{x_1} + \mu\dd{u_1}{x_2}\dd{v_1}{x_2} \,\mbox{d}\bfx,  \\
      a_{12}(u_2, v_1) \!&=&\! \int_\Omega \mu\dd{u_2}{x_1}\dd{v_1}{x_2} + \lambda\dd{u_2}{x_2}\dd{v_1}{x_1} \,\mbox{d}\bfx,\\
      a_{21}(u_1, v_2) \!&=&\! \int_\Omega \mu\dd{u_1}{x_2}\dd{v_2}{x_1} + \lambda\dd{u_1}{x_1}\dd{v_2}{x_2} \,\mbox{d}\bfx,\\
      a_{22}(u_2, v_2) \!&=&\! \int_\Omega (2\mu+\lambda)\dd{u_2}{x_2}\dd{v_2}{x_2} + \mu\dd{u_2}{x_1}\dd{v_2}{x_1} \,\mbox{d}\bfx,  \\
      l_{1}(v_1) \!&=&\!
      \int_{\Gamma_3} \!\!f_1 v_1 \,\mbox{d}S, \\
      l_{2}(v_2) \!&=&\!
      \int_{\Gamma_3} \!\!f_2 v_2 \,\mbox{d}S.
    \end{eqnarray*}

Here, $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are material constants (Lame coefficients) defined as

.. math::

    \mu = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)}, \ \ \ \ \  \lambda = \frac{E\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)},

where $E$ is the Young modulus and $\nu$ the Poisson ratio of the material. For
steel, we have $E = 200$ GPa and $\nu = 0.3$. The load is $f = (0, 10^4)^T$ N.

We begin with defining the function spaces for the two solution
components, $u_1$ and $u_2$ (the $x$ and $y$ displacement). The boundary
conditions can be implemented as
::

    // boundary condition types
    BCType bc_types(int marker)
      { return (marker == 1) ? BC_ESSENTIAL : BC_NATURAL;; }

    // function values for essential(Dirichlet) boundary conditions
    scalar essential_bc_values(int ess_bdy_marker, double x, double y)
      { return 0;}

Next we create the two displacement spaces, xdisp and ydisp:
::

    // create the x displacement space
    H1Space xdisp(&mesh, &shapeset);
    xdisp.set_bc_types(bc_types);
    xdisp.set_essential_bc_values(essential_bc_values);
    xdisp.set_uniform_order(P\_INIT);

    // create the y displacement space
    H1Space ydisp(&mesh, &shapeset);
    ydisp.set_bc_types(bc_types);
    ydisp.set_essential_bc_values(essential_bc_values);
    ydisp.set_uniform_order(P\_INIT);

Our WeakForm instance will be initialized for two equations in the system.
After implementing the weak forms using the predefined integrals
int_a_dudx_dvdx_b_dudy_dvdy and int_a_dudx_dvdy_b_dudy_dvdx,
we can add them to the weak formulation using add_biform().
The first two parameters of this method correspond to the position of the form
in the block weak form :eq:`weaksystem` with zero-based numbering. The 
surface linear form is treated analogously.
::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(2);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(bilinear_form_0_0), H2D_SYM);  // Note that only one symmetric part is
    wf.add_biform(0, 1, callback(bilinear_form_0_1), H2D_SYM);  // added in the case of symmetric bilinear
    wf.add_biform(1, 1, callback(bilinear_form_1_1), H2D_SYM);  // forms.
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, callback(linear_form_surf_0), GAMMA_3_BDY);
    wf.add_liform_surf(1, callback(linear_form_surf_1), GAMMA_3_BDY);

An explanation of the extra parameter H2D_SYM in add_biform() is in order.
Since the two diagonal forms $a_{11}$ and $a_{22}$ are symmetric, i.e.,
$a_{ii}(u,v) = a_{ii}(v,u)$, Hermes can be told to only evaluate them once for the
two cases $a_{ii}(u,v)$ and $a_{ii}(v,u)$ to speed up assembly. In fact, we should have
used the H2D_SYM flag already in the previous sections, since the form
$a(u,v) = \nabla u \cdot \nabla v$ is also symmetric. This is however not the case
for all forms and so the default value of the fourth parameter of add_biform() is H2D_UNSYM.

The off-diagonal forms $a_{12}(u_2, v_1)$ and $a_{21}(u_1, v_2)$ are not
(and cannot) be symmetric, since their arguments come from different spaces.
However, we can see that $a_{12}(u, v) = a_{21}(v, u)$, i.e., the corresponding blocks
of the local stiffness matrix are transposes of each other. Here, the H2D_SYM flag
has a different effect: it tells Hermes to take the block of the local stiffness
matrix corresponding to the form $a_{12}$, transpose it and copy it where a block
corresponding to $a_{21}$ would belong, without evaluating $a_{21}$ at all (this is why
we don't add bilinear_form_1_0). This again speeds up the matrix assembly.
You can also use the flag ANTISYM, which moreover inverts the sign of the block.
This makes sense in the case where $a_{ij}(u, v) = -a_{ji}(v, u)$.

It is recommended that you start with the default (and safe) H2D_UNSYM flag for all
forms when developing your project, and only optimize the evaluation of the forms when
the code works well.

With the WeakForm and spaces ready, we can initialize the linear system.
The only difference is that we now have two spaces determining the discretization
of the problem.
::

    LinSystem sys(&wf, &umfpack);
    sys.set_spaces(2, &xdisp, &ydisp);

All that is left is to assemble the stiffness matrix and solve the system.
Since we have two equations and two spaces, we receive two solutions, one for each
displacement component:
::

    Solution xsln, ysln;
    sys.assemble();
    sys.solve(2, &xsln, &ysln);

As in the previous sections, it is now possible to visualize the displacement
solutions, e.g.,
::

    ScalarView view("y displacement [m]");
    view.show(&ysln);

Usually, however, it is necessary to postprocess the solution in order to obtain more
informative visualization. In elasticity problems, one is often interested in material
stress, which is obtained by a formula combining the derivatives of the two displacements.
Hermes implements postprocessing through *filters*. A filter is a special class
which takes up to three Solutions, performs some computation and in the end acts
as another Solution, which can be visualized, or even fed into another filter.
Here, we can use the predefined filter VonMisesFilter, which calculates the
Von Mises stress:
::

    VonMisesFilter stress(&xsln, &ysln, mu, lambda);
    view.show(&stress, H2D_EPS_HIGH, 0);

The second parameter of show() is the visualization accuracy and can be
H2D_EPS_LOW, H2D_EPS_NORMAL (default) and H2D_EPS_HIGH. The third parameter is
the component number and is only valid for vector-valued ($Hcurl$) solutions.

Finally, in elasticity problems, it may be illustrative to distort the computational
domain according to the calculated displacement. The function View::show() can be
passed three more optional parameters, which represent the $x$ and $y$ displacement
and a multiplier to make the displacements visible.
::

    VonMisesFilter stress(&xsln, &ysln, mu, lambda);
    view.show(&stress, H2D_EPS_HIGH, 0, &xsln, &ysln, 1.5e5);

Time-Dependent Problems (09)

This section describes the implementation of a simple time-dependent
heat transfer model that describes, in a naive approximation, how the St. Vitus cathedral
in Prague responds to changes in the surrounding air temperature
during one 24-hour cycle. The geometry is shown below:

We will solve the standard heat transfer equation

.. math::
    :label: eqvit1

       c \varrho\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \lambda \Delta T = 0

equipped with a Dirichlet condition

.. math::

     T = T_{init}

on the bottom edge $\Gamma_{ground}$ and a Newton condition

.. math::

     \frac{\partial T}{\partial \nu} = \alpha(T_{ext}(t) - T)

on the rest of the boundary $\Gamma_{air}$. Here, $c$ is the heat capacity of the material,
$\varrho$ the material density, $\lambda$ the thermal conductivity,
$T_{init}$ the fixed temperature on the
ground (same as the initial temperature of the building), and $\alpha$
the heat transfer coefficient 
between the building and the surrounding air. The surrounding air temperature
$T_{ext}$ is time-dependent of the form

.. math::

     T_{ext}(t) = T_{init} + 10\sin(2\pi t/T_{final}),

where $T_{final}$ is 24 hours (translated into seconds).

Equation :eq:`eqvit1` is also equipped with an initial condition of the
form

.. math::

     T(x,y,0) = T_{init}(x,y) \ \ \ \mbox{in} \ \Omega.



For simplicity we will use the implicit Euler method with a constant
time step $\tau$, which transforms equation :eq:`eqvit1` into


.. math::

     c \varrho\frac{T^{n+1} - T^n}{\tau} - \lambda \Delta T^{n+1} = 0.

The corresponding weak formulation is

.. math::

     \int_{\Omega} c \varrho\frac{T^{n+1}}{\tau} + \int_{\Omega} \lambda \nabla T^{n+1}\cdot \nabla v + \int_{\Gamma_{air}} \alpha \lambda T^{n+1}v = \int_{\Omega} c \varrho\frac{T^{n}}{\tau} + \int_{\Gamma_{air}} \alpha \lambda T_{ext}(t^{n+1})v.

The implementation starts by defining the
boundary condition types
::

    BCType bc_types(int marker)
    {
      if (marker == marker_ground) return BC_ESSENTIAL;
      else return BC_NATURAL;
    }

and values
::

    scalar essential_bc_values(int ess_bdy_marker, double x, double y)
    {
      if (ess_bdy_marker == marker_ground) return T_INIT;
    }

Then the space for the temperature $T$ is set up:
::

    // set up spaces
    H1Space space(&mesh, &shapeset);
    space.set_bc_types(bc_types);
    space.set_essential_bc_values(essential_bc_values);
    space.set_uniform_order(P_INIT);

The bilinear and linear forms are defined as follows:
::

    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return HEATCAP * RHO * int_u_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v) / TAU +
             LAMBDA * int_grad_u_grad_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }
  
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return HEATCAP * RHO * int_u_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, ext->fn[0], v) / TAU;
    }
  
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar bilinear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return LAMBDA * ALPHA * int_u_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, u, v);
    }
  
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar linear_form_surf(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      return LAMBDA * ALPHA * temp_ext(TIME) * int_v<Real, Scalar>(n, wt, v);
    }

These forms are registered as follows:
::

    // weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, bilinear_form<double, double>, bilinear_form<Ord, Ord>);
    wf.add_biform_surf(0, 0, bilinear_form_surf<double, double>, bilinear_form_surf<Ord, Ord>, marker_air);
    wf.add_liform(0, linear_form<double, double>, linear_form<Ord, Ord>, H2D_ANY, 1, &tsln);
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, linear_form_surf<double, double>, linear_form_surf<Ord, Ord>, marker_air);

Before entering the main iteration loop, we need to initialize the previous solution
tsln with the initial condition $T_{init}$.
Besides holding the finite element solution, the Solution class
can be forced to return zero, to return a constant, or to return an arbitrary function
using the methods set_zero(), set_const() and set_exact(), respectively.
Here we simply call set_const() and supply the initial temperature:
::

    // set initial condition
    Solution tsln;
    tsln.set_const(&mesh, T_INIT);
 
We are now ready to start the iterative process. Since the stiffness matrix does
not depend on the solution, it only needs to be assembled once in the first time
step. For all remaining time steps it will be the same, and we just need to
re-construct the load vector. This is done via the Boolean variable rhsonly
which is set to false before the time stepping begins:
::

    // assemble and solve
    ls.assemble(rhsonly);
    rhsonly = true;
    ls.solve(1, &tsln);
