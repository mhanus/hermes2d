Tutorial Part III (Nonlinear Problems)
======================================

The next part of the tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with basic concepts 
covered in the first part. We will discuss the Newton's method for nonlinear PDE and 
PDE systems, for both stationary and time-dependent models. At the end of this chapter,
the reader will be able to solve time-dependent nonlinear problems adaptively using
dynamical meshes. 

The Newton's Method
-------------------

Hermes can solve nonlinear problems via the Newton's method, both single nonlinear
PDE and nonlinear PDE systems. We begin with explaining how the Newton's method works, and 
concrete implementation details will be shown after that. 
Consider a simple model problem of the form 

.. math::
    :label: newton0

    -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(\bfx) = 0, \ \ \ u = 0 \ \mbox{on}\ \partial \Omega.

Note that when using the Newton's method, it is customary to have 
everything on the left-hand side. The corresponding discrete problem has the form 

.. math::

    \int_{\Omega} \lambda(u)\nabla u(\bfx) \cdot \nabla v_i(\bfx)\, \mbox{d}\bfx 
    - \int_{\Omega} f(\bfx)v_i(\bfx) \, \mbox{d}\bfx\ \ \ \mbox{for all} \ i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, 

where $v_i$ are the standard test functions and

.. math::

    u(\bfY) = \sum_{j=1}^N y_j v_j.

Here $\bfY = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_N)^T$ is the vector of unknown coefficients.
The nonlinear discrete problem can be written in the compact form

.. math::

    \bfF(\bfY) = {\bf 0},
 
where $\bfF = (F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_N)^T$ is the residual vector defined by

.. math::

    F_i(\bfY) =  \int_{\Omega} \lambda(u)\nabla u \cdot \nabla v_i 
    - f v_i \, \mbox{d}\bfx.

The Jacobi matrix $\bfJ(\bfY) = D\bfF/D\bfY$ has the same sparsity structure as the 
standard stiffness matrix that we know from linear problems. In fact, when the 
problem is linear then the Jacobi matrix and the stiffness matrix are the same 
thing. Using the chain rule of differentiation, we calculate that on the 
position $ij$, the Jacobi matrix has the value

.. math::

    J_{ij}(\bfY) =  \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial y_j} = 
    \int_{\Omega} \left[ \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial u} \frac{\partial u}{\partial y_j} 
    \nabla u + \lambda(u)\frac{\partial \nabla u}{\partial y_j} \right] \cdot \nabla v_i \, \mbox{d}\bfx.

To this end, note that 

.. math::

    \frac{\partial u}{\partial y_k} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y_k}\sum_{j=1}^N y_j v_j = v_k

and 

.. math::

    \frac{\partial \nabla u}{\partial y_k} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y_k}\sum_{j=1}^N y_j \nabla v_j = \nabla v_k.


Using these relations, we obtain

.. math::

    J_{ij}(\bfY) =
    \int_{\Omega} \left[ \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial u}(u) v_j 
    \nabla u + \lambda(u)\nabla v_j \right] \cdot \nabla v_i \, \mbox{d}\bfx.

Let's assume that the Jacobi matrix has been assembled. 
The Newton's method is written formally as 

.. math::

    \bfY_{\!\!n+1} = \bfY_{\!\!n} - \bfJ^{-1}(\bfY_{\!\!n}) \bfF(\bfY_{\!\!n}),

but a more practical formula to work with is 

.. math::

    \bfJ(\bfY_{\!\!n})\delta \bfY_{\!\!n+1} =  - \bfF(\bfY_{\!\!n}).

This is a system of linear algebraic equations that needs to be solved in every Newton's 
iteration. The Newton's method will stop when $\bfF(\bfY_{\!\!n+1})$ is sufficiently close 
to the zero vector.

A remark on the linear case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the linear case we have 

.. math::

    \bfF(\bfY) = \bfJ(\bfY)\bfY - \bfb,

where $\bfS = \bfJ(\bfY)$ is a constant stiffness matrix and $\bfb$ a load vector. 
The Newton's method is now

.. math::

    \bfS\bfY_{\!\!n+1} = \bfJ(\bfY_{\!\!n})\bfY_{\!\!n} 
    - \bfJ(\bfY_{\!\!n})\bfY_{\!\!n} + \bfb = \bfb.

Therefore, the Newton's method will converge in one iteration.


Constant Initial Guess (13)
---------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `13-newton-elliptic-1 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/13-newton-elliptic-1>`_.

We will solve the nonlinear model problem defined in the previous section,

.. math::

    -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(x,y) = 0, \ \ \ u = 0 \ \mbox{on}\ \partial \Omega.

One possible interpretation of this equation is stationary heat transfer where the thermal
conductivity $\lambda$ depends on the temperature $u$.
Our domain is a square $\Omega = (-10,10)^2$, $f(x,y) = 1$, and the nonlinearity $\lambda$ has the form 

.. math::

    \lambda(u) = 1 + u^\alpha.

Recall that $\lambda$ must be entirely positive or entirely negative for the problem to be solvable, so it is safe 
to restrict $\alpha$ to be an even nonnegative integer. Recall from the previous section that 

.. math::

    F_i(\bfY) =  \int_{\Omega} \lambda(u)\nabla u \cdot \nabla v_i 
    - f v_i \, \mbox{d}x\mbox{d}y.

and

.. math::

    J_{ij}(\bfY) =
    \int_{\Omega} \left[ \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial u}(u) v_j 
    \nabla u + \lambda(u)\nabla v_j \right] \cdot \nabla v_i \, \mbox{d}x\mbox{d}y.

In the code, this becomes

::

    // Heat sources (can be a general function of 'x' and 'y')
    template<typename Real>
    Real heat_src(Real x, Real y)
    {
      return 1.0;
    }

    // Jacobian matrix
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar jac(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev = ext->fn[0];
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result += wt[i] * (dlam_du(u_prev->val[i]) * u->val[i] * (u_prev->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u_prev->dy[i] * v->dy[i])
                           + lam(u_prev->val[i]) * (u->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u->dy[i] * v->dy[i]));
                       
      return result;
    }

    // Fesidual vector
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar res(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev = ext->fn[0];
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result += wt[i] * (lam(u_prev->val[i]) * (u_prev->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u_prev->dy[i] * v->dy[i])
	    	           - heat_src(e->x[i], e->y[i]) * v->val[i]);
      return result;
    }

Notice that the basis function $v_j$ and the test function 
$v_i$ are entering the weak forms via the parameters u and v, respectively (same as for linear problems). 
The user does not have to 
take care about their indices $i$ and $j$, this is handled by Hermes outside the weak forms. 

The code snippet above also shows how values and derivatives of the solution $u$ can be accessed via 
the ExtData structure, and the coordinates of the integration points via the Geom structure. 
The contents of ExtData is user-defined and the Geom structure contains geometrical information 
including the unit normal and tangential vectors to the boundary at the integration points 
(also for curved boundaries). See the file 
`src/forms.h <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/forms.h>`_ for more details. 

The weak forms are registered as usual, except that the previous solution u_prev has to be declared in advance:

::

    // previous solution for the Newton's iteration
    Solution u_prev;

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(jac), H2D_UNSYM, H2D_ANY, 1, &u_prev);
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(res), H2D_ANY, 1, &u_prev);

The nonlinear system needs to be initialized:

::

    // initialize the nonlinear system and solver
    UmfpackSolver umfpack;
    NonlinSystem nls(&wf, &umfpack);
    nls.set_spaces(1, &space);
    nls.set_pss(1, &pss);

In this example, we set the initial guess for the Newton's iteration to be 
a constant function:

::

    // use a constant function as the initial guess
    u_prev.set_const(&mesh, 3.0);
    nls.project_global(&u_prev, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);

The function project_global() takes an initial guess (the first argument),
projects it on the space determined by the NonlinSystem, and stores the result in the 
second argument. 
The projection norm PROJ_TYPE needs to be compatible with the Sobolev
space where the solution is sought ($H^1$ in this example). 
Hermes currently provides $H^1$-projection (PROJ_TYPE = 1) and 
$L^2$-projection (PROJ_TYPE = 0). Other projections (H(curl), H(div) etc.)
will be added later when a need arises. 

A more advanced example showing how to define a general initial guess 
and how to deal with nonzero Dirichlet boundary conditions will follow. 
The Newton's loop is very simple,

::

    // Newton's loop
    nls.solve_newton(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);

Note that up to three Filters can be passed to the function 
as optional parameters at the end. This function can be found in 
`src/nonlinsystem.h <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/src/nonlinsystem.h>`_.

General Initial Guess (14)
--------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `14-newton-elliptic-2 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/14-newton-elliptic-2>`_.

We will solve the nonlinear model problem from the previous section again,

.. math::

    -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(x,y) = 0 \ \ \ \mbox{in } \Omega = (-10,10)^2

but now with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions 

.. math::

    u(x, y) = (x+10)(y+10)/100 \ \ \ \mbox{on } \partial \Omega

and with a general initial guess init_guess(x,y).

The treatment of the Dirichlet boundary conditions in the code looks as follows:

::

    // This function is used to define Dirichlet boundary conditions
    double dir_lift(double x, double y, double& dx, double& dy) {
      dx = (y+10)/10.;
      dy = (x+10)/10.;
      return (x+10)*(y+10)/100.;
    }

    // Boundary condition type (essential = Dirichlet)
    BCType bc_types(int marker)
    {
      return BC_ESSENTIAL;
    }

    // Dirichlet boundary condition values
    scalar essential_bc_values(int ess_bdy_marker, double x, double y)
    {
      double dx, dy;
      return dir_lift(x, y, dx, dy); 
    }

The initial guess for the Newton's method will be chosen to be the 
Dirichlet lift function elevated by 2:

::

    // This function will be projected on the initial mesh and 
    // used as initial guess for the Newton's method
    scalar init_guess(double x, double y, double& dx, double& dy)
    {
      // using the Dirichlet lift elevated by two
      double val = dir_lift(x, y, dx, dy) + 2;
    }

The initial guess is projected to the finite element space 
determined by NonlinSystem using the project_global()
method:

::

    // project the function init_guess() on the mesh 
    // to obtain initial guess u_prev for the Newton's method
    nls.project_global(init_guess, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);

This function creates an orthogonal projection of the initial guess
on the mesh "mesh" and stores the result in u_prev. 
The following figure shows the  
$H^1$-projection of the above-defined initial guess init_guess():

.. image:: img/example-14/proj-h1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :height: 350
   :alt: H1 projection

The Newton's iteration is performed again using

::

    // Newton's loop
    nls.solve_newton(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);


The converged solution after 7 steps of the Newton's
method looks as follows:

Newton's Method and Adaptivity (15)
-----------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `15-newton-elliptic-adapt 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/15-newton-elliptic-adapt>`_.

We will keep the simple model problem

.. math::

    -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(x,y) = 0 \ \ \ \mbox{in } \Omega = (-10,10)^2,

equipped with nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions 

.. math::

    u(x, y) = (x+10)(y+10)/100 \ \ \ \mbox{on } \partial \Omega,

but this time it will be solved using automatic adaptivity. As usual in Hermes, adaptivity
will be guided by the difference between a coarse and fine mesh approximations. At the beginning,
the initial condition is projected on the coarse mesh:

::

    // project the function init_guess() on the coarse mesh 
    // to obtain initial guess u_prev for the Newton's method
    nls.project_global(init_guess, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);

Then we solve the nonlinear problem on the coarse mesh and store
the coarse mesh solution:

::

    // Newton's loop on the coarse mesh
    info("---- Solving on coarse mesh:");
    if (!nls.solve_newton(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL_COARSE, NEWTON_MAX_ITER)) error("Newton's method did not converge.");

    // store the result in sln_coarse
    sln_coarse.copy(&u_prev);

In order to support adaptivity, a selector is created:

::

    H1ProjBasedSelector selector(CAND_LIST, CONV_EXP, H2DRS_DEFAULT_ORDER, &shapeset);

Next the nonlinear problem on the fine mesh is initialized as follows:

::

    // Setting initial guess for the Newton's method on the fine mesh
    RefNonlinSystem rnls(&nls);
    rnls.prepare();
    if (a_step == 1) rnls.project_global(&sln_coarse, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);
    else rnls.project_global(&sln_fine, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);    

Notice that we only use sln_coarse as the initial guess on the fine mesh 
in the first adaptivity step when we do not have any fine mesh solution yet,
otherwise a projection of the last fine mesh solution is used. Then we perform the 
Newton's loop on the fine mesh and store the result in sln_fine:

::

    // Newton's loop on the fine mesh
    if (!rnls.solve_newton(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL_FINE, NEWTON_MAX_ITER)) error("Newton's method did not converge.");

    // stote the fine mesh solution in sln_fine
    sln_fine.copy(&u_prev);

Now we have the desired solution pair, and the error estimate is calculated as usual:

::

    // calculate element errors and total error estimate
    H1Adapt hp(&space);
    hp.set_solutions(&sln_coarse, &sln_fine);
    err_est = hp.calc_error() * 100;

After adapting the mesh, we must not forget to update the coarse mesh solution. 
This can be done either by just projecting the fine mesh solution onto 
the new coarse mesh, or by solving in addition to that the nonlinear
problem on the new coarse mesh:

::

    // if err_est too large, adapt the mesh
    if (err_est < ERR_STOP) done = true;
    else {
      hp.adapt(&selector, THRESHOLD, STRATEGY, MESH_REGULARITY);
      int ndof = assign_dofs(&space);
      if (ndof >= NDOF_STOP) done = true;

      // project the fine mesh solution on the new coarse mesh
      info("---- Projecting fine mesh solution on new coarse mesh:\n");
      nls.project_global(&sln_fine, &u_prev, PROJ_TYPE);

      if (NEWTON_ON_COARSE_MESH) {
        // Newton's loop on the coarse mesh
        info("---- Solving on coarse mesh:\n");
        if (!nls.solve_newton(&u_prev, NEWTON_TOL_COARSE, NEWTON_MAX_ITER)) error("Newton's method did not converge.");
      }

      // store the result in sln_coarse
      sln_coarse.copy(&u_prev);
    }

The parameter NEWTON_ON_COARSE_MESH is provided to allow the user to do his 
own experiments, but the default value is NEWTON_ON_COARSE_MESH = false.
In our experience, the Newton's loop on the coarse mesh can be skipped
in most cases since it does not affect the convergence and one saves some
CPU time. This is illustrated in the following two convergence comparisons:

Convergence in the number of DOF (with and without Newton solve on coarse mesh):

.. image:: img/example-15/conv_dof_compar.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :height: 400
   :alt: DOF convergence graph for tutorial example 15.

Convergence in CPU time (with and without Newton solve on coarse mesh):

   :align: center

In the following we show the resulting meshes (corresponding to 
NEWTON_ON_COARSE_MESH = false). The solution itself is not 
shown since the reader knows it from the previous example.

Nonlinear Parabolic Problem (16)
--------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `16-newton-timedep-heat 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/16-newton-timedep-heat>`_.

We will employ the Newton's method to solve a nonlinear parabolic PDE discretized 
in time by means of the implicit Euler method. To keep things simple, our model problem is 
a time-dependent version of the nonlinear equation used in the previous three sections,

.. math::

    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} -\nabla \cdot (\lambda(u)\nabla u) - f(x,y) = 0.

Again we prescribe nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions 

.. math::

    u(x, y) = (x+10)(y+10)/100 \ \ \ \mbox{on } \partial \Omega,

and the same function is used to define the initial condition. The 
problem will be solved in the square $\Omega = (-10,10)^2$ and time interval $(0, T)$.

The weak formulation of the time-discretized problem reads

.. math::

    \int_{\Omega} \frac{u^{n+1} - u^n}{\tau}v + \lambda(u^{n+1})\nabla u^{n+1}\cdot \nabla v - fv\, \mbox{d}x\mbox{d}y = 0,

where the indices $n$ and $n+1$ indicate the previous and new time level, respectively. Hence in each 
time step we need to solve a *time-independent* nonlinear problem, and this is something we learned 
in the previous sections. The weak forms for the Newton's method from the previous sections only 
need to be enhanced with a simple term containing the time step $\tau$ (called TAU):

::

    // Jacobian matrix
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar jac(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *u, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev_newton = ext->fn[0];
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result += wt[i] * (u->val[i] * v->val[i] / TAU + dlam_du(u_prev_newton->val[i]) * u->val[i] * 
                           (u_prev_newton->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u_prev_newton->dy[i] * v->dy[i])
                           + lam(u_prev_newton->val[i]) * (u->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u->dy[i] * v->dy[i]));                    
      return result;
    }

Here the function u_prev_newton plays the role of u_prev from the previous sections - this is the 
previous solution inside the Newton's iteration. Note that the previous time level solution 
$u^n$ that we call u_prev_time is not used in the Jacobian. It is used in the residual only:

::

    // Fesidual vector
    template<typename Real, typename Scalar>
    Scalar res(int n, double *wt, Func<Real> *v, Geom<Real> *e, ExtData<Scalar> *ext)
    {
      Scalar result = 0;
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev_newton = ext->fn[0];
      Func<Scalar>* u_prev_time = ext->fn[1];
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        result += wt[i] * ((u_prev_newton->val[i] - u_prev_time->val[i]) * v->val[i] / TAU +
                          lam(u_prev_newton->val[i]) * (u_prev_newton->dx[i] * v->dx[i] + u_prev_newton->dy[i] * v->dy[i])
		           - heat_src(e->x[i], e->y[i]) * v->val[i]);
      return result;
    }

Notice that the function u_prev_newton evolves during the Newton's iteration
but the previous time level solution u_prev_time only is updated after the time step
is finished. The weak forms and the previous solutions are registered as usual:

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(1);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(jac), H2D_UNSYM, H2D_ANY, 1, &u_prev_newton);
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(res), H2D_ANY, 2, &u_prev_newton, &u_prev_time);

The entire time-stepping loop looks as follows:

::

    // time stepping loop
    double current_time = 0.0;
    int t_step = 1;
    do {
      info("---- Time step %d, t = %g s:", t_step, current_time); t_step++;

      // Newton's method
      nls.solve_newton(&u_prev_newton, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);

      // update previous time level solution
      u_prev_time.copy(&u_prev_newton);

      // update time
      current_time += TAU;

    } while (current_time < T_FINAL);

The stationary solution is not shown since we already saw it in the previous sections.


Flame Propagation Problem (17)
------------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `17-newton-timedep-flame 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/17-newton-timedep-flame>`_.

We will employ the Newton's method to solve a nonlinear system of two parabolic equations 
describing a very simple flame propagation model (laminar flame, no fluid mechanics involved).
The computational domain shown below contains in the middle a narrow portion (cooling rods) 
whose purpose is to slow down the chemical reaction:

.. image:: img/example-17/domain.png
   :align: center
   :width: 760
   :alt: computational domain

The equations for the temperature $T$ and species concentration $Y$ have the form

.. math::

    \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \Delta T = \omega(T, Y),\\
    \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t} - \frac{1}{Le}\Delta Y = -\omega(T, Y).

Boundary conditions are Dirichlet $T = 1$ and $Y = 0$ on the inlet, 
Newton $\partial T/\partial n = - \kappa T$ on the cooling rods, 
and Neumann $\partial T/\partial n = 0$, $\partial Y/\partial n = 0$ elsewhere.
The objective of the computation is to obtain the *reaction rate* defined
by the Arrhenius law,

.. math::

    \omega(T, Y) = \frac{\beta^2}{2{\rm Le}} Y e^{\frac{\beta(T - 1)}{1 + \alpha(T-1)}}.

Here $\alpha$ is the gas expansion coefficient in a flow with nonconstant density,
$\beta$ the non-dimensional activation energy, and  
$\rm Le$ the Lewis number (ratio of diffusivity of heat and diffusivity 
of mass). Both $\theta$, $0 \le \theta \le 1$ and 
$Y$, $0 \le Y \le 1$ are dimensionless and so is the time $t$. 

Time integration is performed using a second-order implicit BDF formula

.. math::

    T^{n+1} = -\frac{1}{2} T_1^{n+1} + \frac{3}{2} T_2^{n+1},\\
    Y^{n+1} = -\frac{1}{2} Y_1^{n+1} + \frac{3}{2} Y_2^{n+1},

that is obtained using a combination of the following two first-order methods:

.. math::

    \frac{T_1^{n+1} - T^{n}}{\tau} = \Delta T_1^{n+1} + \omega(T_1^{n+1}, Y_1^{n+1}),\\
    \frac{Y_1^{n+1} - Y^{n}}{\tau} = \frac{1}{\rm Le} \ \Delta Y_1^{n+1} - \omega(\theta_1^{n+1}, Y_1^{n+1}),

and 

.. math::

    \frac{T_2^{n+1} - T^{n}}{\tau} = \frac{2}{3}\left(\Delta T_2^{n+1} + \omega(T_2^{n+1}, Y_2^{n+1})\right) +                                            \frac{1}{3}\left(\Delta T_2^{n} + \omega(T_2^{n}, Y_2^{n})\right),\\
    \frac{Y_2^{n+1} - Y^{n}}{\tau} = \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{\rm Le}\ \Delta Y_2^{n+1} - \omega(T_2^{n+1}, Y_2^{n+1})\right) +
                                        \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{\rm Le}\ \Delta Y_2^{n} - \omega(T_2^{n}, Y_2^{n})\right).
   
Problem parameters are chosen as

::

    // Problem constants
    const double Le    = 1.0;
    const double alpha = 0.8;
    const double beta  = 10.0;
    const double kappa = 0.1;
    const double x1 = 9.0;

It is worth mentioning that the initial conditions for $T$ and $Y$,

::

    // Initial conditions
    scalar temp_ic(double x, double y, scalar& dx, scalar& dy)
      { return (x <= x1) ? 1.0 : exp(x1 - x); }

    scalar conc_ic(double x, double y, scalar& dx, scalar& dy)
      { return (x <= x1) ? 0.0 : 1.0 - exp(Le*(x1 - x)); }

are defined as exact functions

::

    // setting initial conditions
    t_prev_time_1.set_exact(&mesh, temp_ic); y_prev_time_1.set_exact(&mesh, conc_ic);
    t_prev_time_2.set_exact(&mesh, temp_ic); y_prev_time_2.set_exact(&mesh, conc_ic);
    t_prev_newton.set_exact(&mesh, temp_ic);  y_prev_newton.set_exact(&mesh, conc_ic);

Here the pairs of solutions (t_prev_time_1, y_prev_time_1) and (t_prev_time_2, y_prev_time_2)
correspond to the two first-order time-stepping methods described above. and 
(t_prev_newton, y_prev_newton) are used to store the previous step approximation
in the Newton's method. The reaction rate $\omega$ and its derivatives are handled
via filters,

::

    // defining filters for the reaction rate omega
    DXDYFilter omega(omega_fn, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton);
    DXDYFilter omega_dt(omega_dt_fn, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton);
    DXDYFilter omega_dy(omega_dy_fn, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton);

Details on the functions omega_fn, omega_dt_fn, omega_dy_fn and the weak 
forms can be found in the file `forms.cpp 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/tutorial/17-newton-timedep-flame/forms.cpp>`_
Here is how we register the weak forms,

::

    // initialize the weak formulation
    WeakForm wf(2);
    wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(newton_bilinear_form_0_0), H2D_UNSYM, H2D_ANY, 1, &omega_dt);
    wf.add_biform_surf(0, 0, callback(newton_bilinear_form_0_0_surf), 3);
    wf.add_biform(0, 1, callback(newton_bilinear_form_0_1), H2D_UNSYM, H2D_ANY, 1, &omega_dy);
    wf.add_biform(1, 0, callback(newton_bilinear_form_1_0), H2D_UNSYM, H2D_ANY, 1, &omega_dt);
    wf.add_biform(1, 1, callback(newton_bilinear_form_1_1), H2D_UNSYM, H2D_ANY, 1, &omega_dy);
    wf.add_liform(0, callback(newton_linear_form_0), H2D_ANY, 4, &t_prev_newton, &t_prev_time_1, &t_prev_time_2, &omega);
    wf.add_liform_surf(0, callback(newton_linear_form_0_surf), 3, 1, &t_prev_newton);
    wf.add_liform(1, callback(newton_linear_form_1), H2D_ANY, 4, &y_prev_newton, &y_prev_time_1, &y_prev_time_2, &omega);

and how we initialize the nonlinear system and solver:

::

  // initialize the nonlinear system and solver
  UmfpackSolver umfpack;
  NonlinSystem nls(&wf, &umfpack);
  nls.set_spaces(2, &tspace, &cspace);
  nls.set_pss(1, &pss);
  nls.project_global(&t_prev_time_1, &y_prev_time_1, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton, PROJ_TYPE);

The time stepping loop looks as follows, notice the visualization of $\omega$
through a DXDYFilter:

::

    // time stepping loop
    double current_time = 0.0;
    int t_step = 0;
    do {
      info("\n**** Time step %d, t = %g s:\n", ++t_step, current_time);

      // Newton's method
      nls.solve_newton(&t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER, 
                         &omega, &omega_dt, &omega_dy);

      // visualization
      DXDYFilter omega_view(omega_fn, &t_prev_newton, &y_prev_newton);
      rview.set_min_max_range(0.0,2.0);
      char title[100];
      sprintf(title, "Reaction rate, t = %g", current_time);
      rview.set_title(title);
      rview.show(&omega_view);

      // update current time
      current_time += TAU;

      // store two previous time solutions
      t_prev_time_2.copy(&t_prev_time_1);
      y_prev_time_2.copy(&y_prev_time_1);
      t_prev_time_1.copy(&t_prev_newton);
      y_prev_time_1.copy(&y_prev_newton);
    } while (current_time <= T_FINAL);

Navier-Stokes Equations (18)
----------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `18-newton-timedep-ns 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/18-newton-timedep-ns>`_.

In this example, the time-dependent laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are
discretized in time via the implicit Euler method. If NEWTON == true,
the Newton's method is used to solve the nonlinear problem at each time 
step. If NEWTON == false, the convective term only is linearized using the 
velocities from the previous time step. Obviously the latter approach is wrong, 
but people do this frequently because it is faster and simpler to implement. 
Therefore we include this case for comparison purposes. We also show how 
to use discontinuous ($L^2$) elements for pressure and thus make the 
velocity discreetely divergence free. Comparison to approximating the 
pressure with the standard (continuous) Taylor-Hood elements is shown.  

The computational domain is a rectangular channel containing a 
circular obstacle: 

.. image:: img/example-18/domain.png
   :align: center
   :width: 760
   :alt: computational domain

The circle is defined via NURBS. Its radius and position, as well as some additional 
geometry parameters can be changed in the mesh file "domain.mesh":

::

    L = 15            # domain length (should be a multiple of 3)
    H = 5             # domain height
    S1 = 5/2          # x-center of circle
    S2 = 5/2          # y-center of circle
    R = 1             # circle radius
    A = 1/(2*sqrt(2)) # helper length
    EPS = 0.10        # vertical shift of the circle

The Navier-Stokes equations are assumed in the standard form

.. math::

    \frac{\partial \bfv}{\partial t} - \frac{1}{Re}\Delta \bfv + (\bfv \cdot \nabla) \bfv + \nabla p = 0,\\
    \mbox{div} \bfv = 0,

where $\bfv = (u, v)$ is the velocity vector, $Re$ the Reynolds number, $p$ the pressure,
and $(\bfv \cdot \nabla) \bfv$ the nonlinear convective term. We prescribe a parabolic 
velocity profile at inlet (the left-most edge). The inlet velocity is time-dependent, it 
increases linearly in time from zero to a user-defined value during an initial time period, 
and then it stays constant. Standard no-slip velocity boundary conditions are prescribed 
on the rest of the boundary with the exception of the outlet (right-most edge) where the 
standard "do nothing" boundary conditions are prescribed. No boundary conditions are 
prescribed for pressure - being an $L^2$-function, the pressure does not 
admit any boundary conditions. 

The role of the pressure in the Navier-Stokes equations 
is interesting and worth a brief discussion. Since the equations only contain its gradient, 
it is determined up to a constant. This does not mean that the problem is ill-conditioned 
though, since the pressure only plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier that keeps 
the velocity divergence-free. More precisely, the better the pressure is resolved, 
the closer the approximate velocity to being divergence free. The best one can do
is to approximate the pressure in $L^2$ (using discontinuous elements). Not only because
it is more meaningful from the point of view of the weak formulation, but also because
the approximate velocity automatically becomes discreetely divergence-free (integral 
of its divergence over every element in the mesh is zero). The standard Taylor-Hood 
elements approximating both the velocity and pressure with $H^1$-conforming (continuous)
elements do not have this property and thus are less accurate. We will compare these
two approaches below. Last, the pressure needs to be approximated by elements of 
a lower polynomial degree than the velocity in order to satisfy the inf-sup condition.

The time derivative is approximated using the implicit Euler method:

.. math::

    \frac{\bfv^{n+1}}{\tau} - \frac{\bfv^n}{\tau} - \frac{1}{Re}\Delta \bfv^{n+1} + (\bfv^{n+1} \cdot \nabla) \bfv^{n+1} + \nabla p^{n+1} = 0,\\
    \mbox{div} \bfv^{n+1} = 0,

where $\tau$ is the time step. This is a nonlinear problem that involves three equations (two for velocity components and 
the continuity equation). Accordingly, we define three spaces:

::

      // spaces for velocities and pressure
      H1Space xvel_space(&mesh, &h1_shapeset);
      H1Space yvel_space(&mesh, &h1_shapeset);
    #ifdef PRESSURE_IN_L2
      L2Space p_space(&mesh, &l2_shapeset);
    #else
      H1Space p_space(&mesh, &h1_shapeset);
    #endif

Next we define a nonlinear or linear problem to be solved in each time step,
depending on whether we want to employ the Newton's method or not:

::

      if (NEWTON) {
        // set up the nonlinear system
        nls.set_spaces(3, &xvel_space, &yvel_space, &p_space);
    #ifdef PRESSURE_IN_L2
        nls.set_pss(3, &h1_pss, &h1_pss, &l2_pss);
    #else
        nls.set_pss(1, &h1_pss);
    #endif
      }
      else {
        // set up the linear system
        ls.set_spaces(3, &xvel_space, &yvel_space, &p_space);
    #ifdef PRESSURE_IN_L2
        ls.set_pss(3, &h1_pss, &h1_pss, &l2_pss);
    #else
        ls.set_pss(1, &h1_pss);
    #endif
      }

The time stepping loop looks as follows:

::

    // time-stepping loop
    char title[100];
    int num_time_steps = T_FINAL / TAU;
    for (int i = 1; i <= num_time_steps; i++)
    {
      TIME += TAU;

      info("---- Time step %d, time = %g:", i, TIME);

      // this is needed to update the time-dependent boundary conditions
      ndof = assign_dofs(3, &xvel_space, &yvel_space, &p_space);

      if (NEWTON) {
        // Newton's method
        nls.solve_newton(&xvel_prev_newton, &yvel_prev_newton, &p_prev, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);

        // copy the result of the Newton's iteration into the 
        // previous time level solutions
        xvel_prev_time.copy(&xvel_prev_newton);
        yvel_prev_time.copy(&yvel_prev_newton);
      }
      else {
        // assemble and solve
        Solution xvel_sln, yvel_sln, p_sln;
        ls.assemble();
        ls.solve(3, &xvel_sln, &yvel_sln, &p_sln);

        // this copy destroys xvel_sln and yvel_sln 
        // which are no longer needed
        xvel_prev_time = xvel_sln;
        yvel_prev_time = yvel_sln;
      }
    }

The following comparisons demonstrate the effect of using the Newton's method, and continuous vs. discontinuous 
elements for the pressure. There are three triplets of velocity snapshots. In each one, the images 
were obtained with (1) NEWTON == false && PRESSURE_IN_L2 undefined, (2) NEWTON == true && PRESSURE_IN_L2 
undefined, and (3) NEWTON == true && PRESSURE_IN_L2 defined. It follows from these comparisons that one 
should definitely use the option (3).

Gross-Pitaevski Equation (19)
-----------------------------

**Git reference:** Tutorial example `19-newton-timedep-gp 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/tree/HEAD:/tutorial/19-newton-timedep-gp>`_.

In this example we use the Newton's method to solve the nonlinear complex-valued 
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevski equation. This equation describes the ground state of 
a quantum system of identical bosons using the Hartree–Fock approximation and the 
pseudopotential interaction model. For time-discretization one can use either
the first-order implicit Euler method or the second-order Crank-Nicolson
method. 

The computational domain is the square $(-1,1)^2$ and boundary conditions are zero Dirichlet. The equation has the form 

.. math::

    i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \Delta \psi + g \psi |\psi|^2 + \frac{m}{2} \omega^2 (x^2 + y^2) \psi

where $\psi(x,y)$ is the unknown solution (wave function), $i$ the complex unit, 
$\hbar$ the Planck constant, $m$ the mass of the boson, 
$g$ the coupling constant (proportional to the scattering length of two interacting bosons) and 
$\omega$ the frequency.

From the implementation point of view, the only detail worth mentioning is the 
use of the complex version of Hermes in the file `CMakeLists.txt <http://git.hpfem.org/hermes2d.git/blob/HEAD:/tutorial/19-newton-timedep-gp/CMakeLists.txt>`_:

      wf.add_biform(0, 0, callback(jacobian_cranic), H2D_UNSYM, H2D_ANY, 1, &Psi_prev_newton);
      wf.add_liform(0, callback(residuum_cranic), H2D_ANY, 2, &Psi_prev_newton, &Psi_prev_time);
    }

Also the time stepping loop and the call to the Newton's method 
will not surprize a reader who made it this far in the tutorial:

::

    // time stepping loop
    int nstep = (int)(T_FINAL/TAU + 0.5);
    for(int n = 1; n <= nstep; n++)
    {
      info("---- Time step %d:", n);

      // Newton's method
      nls.solve_newton(&Psi_prev_newton, NEWTON_TOL, NEWTON_MAX_ITER);

      // copy result of the Newton's iteration into Psi_prev_time
      Psi_prev_time.copy(&Psi_prev_newton);
    }
